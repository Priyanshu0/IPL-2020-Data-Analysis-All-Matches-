# IPL-2020-Data-Analysis-All-Matches-
Widhya is a organization who conducted data analytics hackathon on 2020 IPL for 1month which is called WPL. They will post 5 Questions for each match and we have to come up with data driven strategies.

I used 2 datasets 

### 1)Matches dataset - 

Which contain data about all matches from 2008-2019. It has 256 rows and 18 features.

### 2)Deliveries dataset - 

Which contain data about every ball of the match. It has 179078 rows and 21 features.

'Match_id' column is common between both datasets.
